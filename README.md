# Singly-linked-list

Singly linked list is a data structure in computer science. It is a linear collection of data elements whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory rather, each element points to the next. Each element is called a node. Each node holds a data and a pointer to save the address of the next node or point to it, except the last node which points to null. In case of singly linked list traversal is possible in only one direction.
